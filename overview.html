<p>Description: As the density of wireless, resource-constrained sensors grows, so does the need to choreograph their 
    actions across both time and space. We aim to develop a novel approach to simultaneously localizing and time 
    synchronizing networked mobile devices. We would like to extend the size of a network of test beds by duplicating 
    an available PCB design to show the scalability factor. Then use scalable distributed kalman filter to simultaneously 
    localize and time synchronize a network of testbeds.</p>
<p>The Networked and Embedded Systems Lab (NESL) currently has a setup with several monitors placed around the room, 
    tracking a series of stationary nodes using UWB. Existing programs allow us to estimate their positions and clock 
    skew by utilizing a distributed Kalman filter at each node. The problem is that each node currently works with 
    state vectors containing information about all nodes; as the number of nodes increases, such computation will 
    quickly grow to become unscalable.

    Our current goal is to implement a distributed Kalman filtering scheme at each node that allows each node to 
    estimate its own state and that of its neighbors, without requiring data or estimation about other nodes in the 
    network. Preliminary research has identified two papers of possible use; "Distributing the Kalman Filter for 
    Large-Scale Systems", by Usman A. Khan and Jos&eacute; M.F. Moura, and "Distributed Kalman Filtering for Sensor 
    Networks", by R. Olfati-Saber.
